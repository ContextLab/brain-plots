Industry standard brain plotting programs are great for producing publication-quality images of brain data. However, these tools are often very slow. This suite of tools provides a means of quickly generating 2- or 3-dimensional plots of fMRI data that can be manipulated (e.g. rotated, modified) in real time.

Although these tools may be used to produce publication-quality figures, the focus here is on speed and ease of use. These tools are intended to be used for quickly exploring and examining fMRI data, debugging fMRI analyses, etc.
